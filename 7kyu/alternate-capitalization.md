# Alternate Capitalization



- [Alternate Capitalization Challenge](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59cfc000aeb2844d16000075).



## TypeScript



### v3

In v3 we use a tuple of `[string, string]` as a return type `altCaps()` and a tuple `[string[], string[]]` for the intermediate results. It makes more sense we use a tuple rather than normal arrays because we know we are dealing with something that will return exactly two strings; one for each capitalization variation.
